## Disclaimer

These notebooks are intended to simulate GEDI footprint-based predictions and are not designed to generate wall-to-wall (W2W) biomass maps.

Users should be aware that extending this workflow to full-coverage biomass mapping introduces major inference challenges. 

Proper statistical modeling would require accounting for sampling design, model uncertainty, and spatial autocorrelation â€” which are **not addressed** in this workflow.  

For official or robust biomass estimation, the use of validated W2W products or appropriately designed model-assisted approaches is recommended.
